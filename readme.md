# The Interactive Extensions for JavaScript... #
*...is a set of libraries to compose pull-based collections and LINQ-style query operators in JavaScript*

The Interactive Extensions for JavaScript (IxJS) is an implementation of Language Integrated Query (LINQ) to Objects in native JavaScript with a core set of operators on par with the [.NET implementation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb397926.aspx).  This implementation uses the same techniques for lazy evaluation of chained functions, for example map/select and filter/where.  This allows you as the user to write rich expressive queries against a number of data sources without taking a performance hit.  

We provide two files, a core implementation of LINQ to Objects in l2o.js and the Interactive Extensions in ix.js.  The Interactive Extensions is a set of functions that were found to be useful for the Reactive Extensions (Rx) and were ported from the push model of Rx to a pull model.

Getting started is easy.  Just reference the IxJS files:

	<script src="l2o.js"></script>
	<script src="ix.js"></script>

Next, we could generate data, filter it and then display the results
```js
// Generate the data
var data = Ix.Enumerable.range(0, 10);

// Query the data
var query = data
	.map( function (x) {
		return x * x;
	})
	.filter( function (x) {
		return x % 3 === 0;
	});

// Now execute the query
query.forEach( function (x, idx) {
	console.log(x, idx);
});
```
Note the execution of the query doesn't take place until forEach is called.

## About the Interactive Extensions Extensions ##

This set of libraries include:

- **l2o.js** - Core LINQ to Objects library
- **ix.js** - Interactive Extensions for JavaScript

##  API Documentation ##

You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/IxJS/tree/master/doc) as well as examples [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/IxJS/tree/master/examples).

## Installation and Usage ##

There are multiple ways of getting started with the Interactive Extensions.  The files are available on [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/) and [jsDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!ixjs).

### In a Browser:

    <script src="l2o.js"></script>
    <script src="ix.js"></script>

### Installing with [Bower](http://bower.io/)

	bower install Ix

### Installing via [NPM](https://npmjs.org/):

> You must specify a version of 1.0.6 or earlier to retrieve this package from npm 

    npm install ix@1.0.6
    npm install -g ix@1.0.6

### Using in Node.js:
```js
var Ix = require('ix');

var source = Ix.Enumerable.fromArray([1,2,3]);

source.forEach(function (x) {
	console.log('Next: ' + x);	
});

// => Next 1 
// => Next 2 
// => Next 3
```
Installing all of IxJS via [NuGet](http://nuget.org/):

    Install-Package IxJS-All

Or install via [NuGet](http://nuget.org/) individual packages:

    Install-Package IxJS-L2O
    Install-Package IxJS-Main

### Using IxJS with an AMD loader such as Require.js
```js
require({
    'paths': {
        'ix': 'path/to/ix.js'
    }
},
['ix'], function(Ix) {
    var obs = Ix.Enumerable.returnValue(42);
    obs.forEach(function (x) { 
    	console.log('Next: ' + x); 
	});
});

// => Next 42 
```
## Compatibility ##

IxJS has been thoroughly tested against all major browsers and supports IE6+, Chrome 4+, FireFox 1+, and Node.js v0.4+.
